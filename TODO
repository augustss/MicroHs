* Add strict constructors
* Put on hackage
* Have compile return a Stats record of timing etc
* Special noMatch function with location
* Add overloading
* Implement deriving
* Add forall to the syntax of types so it can be nested
  - Rank-N requires small changes in the type checker
* Implement mutual recursion in let
  - Use SCC
* Add the possibility to save a compiler cache in a file
  - Add SHA checksumming to the C code
  - Use filename as the cache lookup key and SHA for validation
* use 'data = primitive "Int"' for primitive types.
* make an interactive version
  - implement a simple readline
  - implement catch (and maybe throw) using setjmp & longjmp
  - make the runtime system catch ^C and stop execution
* implement low level equality
  - maybe?
  - could be used instead of derived when all is derived
* use pointer stack during GC instead of recursion.
* add Double primitive type
* implement Data.Integer
* add pretty printing library
